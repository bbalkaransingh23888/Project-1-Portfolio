Project Worksheet – Project One – Portfolio Site
SEI-pineapple

Project Description:
This will be a portfolio site that will showcase my skills, projects, qualifications, and other information that employers and clients can use to make hiring decisions about me. I will include an About Me section, Projects section, Contact section, a section for links such as to my blog and to GitHub, an email registry, and a brief introduction section that includes a profile pic. For now, I will keep everything on one page as I want to keep this as simple as possible, and use the menu items to navigate to the appropriate section on the page. I shall be taking a mobile-first approach to building this site, meaning that I will design my site for a mobile device first, then scale it up to desktop and tablet devices using media queries. I will be using pages from the previous SEI students for inspiration as far as how I want my portfolio to look and function. I’ll put more information on that at a later point as I iron out the kinks.
